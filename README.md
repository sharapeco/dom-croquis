# html-to-canvas

This library renders the current DOM to a canvas element, similar to [niklasvh/html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas). While it provides the same core functionality of converting web pages to canvas elements, it achieves superior performance by supporting a limited set of CSS features. This focused approach allows for faster rendering times compared to html2canvas, making it an ideal choice for scenarios where high performance is prioritized over complete CSS feature support.
